Samples were processed using the following protocol using the Geneious Prime Software:

1. Raw Sequences were merged into Paired Reads using "BBMerge Paired Read Merger Version 38.37 by Brian Bushnell" using default settings, which in this case was Merge Rate: High.
2. Paired Reads were Trimmed using BBDuk Adapter/Quality Trimming Version 38.37 by Brian Bushnell using defaults settings for Illumina Truseq DNA adapters; Trim: Right end; Kmer length: 27; Maximum Substitutions: 1; Minimum Quality: 30; Minimum Overlap: 20; Minimum Length: 100 bp.
3. Sequences were Error Corrected and Normalized using "BBNorm Error correction and read normalization version 38.37 by Brian Bushnell" using default settings.
4. Duplicate reads were removed using Dedupe Duplicate Read Remover 38.37 by Brian Bushnell  on default settings: Kmer seed length: 31
5. Chimerica reads were removed using UCHIME v4.2.40 Chimeric sequence detection using a reference database by Robert Edgar using default settings and Multiple Sea Urchin Mitochondrion Genome Alignments


After processing the samples was completed a de novo assembly was conducted using: Velvet 1.2.10 - algorithms for de novo short read assembly using de Bruijn graphs
